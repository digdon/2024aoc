# Day 23: LAN Party
This one gave me lots of grief because I couldn't quite understand that part 1 involved finding "triangles" of nodes. 2024 was definitely the year of reading comprehension and I couldn't figure this one out. Went to reddit for assitance and as soon as I saw the mention of triangles, I knew how to figure it out.

Part 2.... yeah, beyond my abilities. Reddit mentioned using [Bron-Kerbosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bron%E2%80%93Kerbosch_algorithm), so I went looking that up. Seems simple enough, but my knowledge of set theory wasn't good enough to recognize set theory language. Used ChatGPT to get some implementation hints and that got me over the finish line. Basically, I was having issues with needing copies of the R set because we're only temporarily modifying it. Interestingly, ChatGPT mentioned needing a copy of P as well, but this does not actually appear to be necessary. This may have been in anticipation of using a pivot, which I did not do.

Update: My code was fast enough, but I thought I'd implement pivoting to see how that affects things. I added degree-based and greedy pivots. Degree-based was by far the greatest improvement, dropping time down from about 220ms to just 15ms.
